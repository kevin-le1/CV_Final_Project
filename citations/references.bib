@article{attention_mechanisms,
	abstract = {In a global context, the production of urban solid waste significantly varies with changes in living standards. This trend exhibits diversity across different countries and regions, reflecting shifts in lifestyles as well as varying needs and challenges in waste management strategies. However, current standards of waste recycling are too complex for the general public to follow. In this study, we propose a model called DSYOLO-Trash to identify solid waste by integrating the dual attention mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and Contextual Transformer Networks(CotNet), which significantly enhance its ability to mine channel-related and spatial attention features while optimizing the learning process. We apply the deep simple online and realtime tracking (DeepSORT) object tracking algorithm to solid waste detection for the first time in the literature to enable the real-time identification and tracking of waste. We also develop a multi-label dataset of mixed solid waste, called MMTrash, to realistically simulate actual scenarios of waste classification. Our proposed DSYOLO-Trash delivered superior performance to classical detection algorithms on both the MMTrash and the TrashNet datasets. Our system combines the improved you only look once(YOLO) algorithm with DeepSORT technology by using industrial cameras and PLC-controlled robotic arms to intelligently sort waste. The work here constitutes an important contribution to intelligent waste management and the sustainable development of cities.},

@article{plastic_pollution_consequences,
	abstract = {Plastic pollution is recognized as a severe anthropogenic issue in the coastal and marine ecosystems across the world. Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m3 in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m3 in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce-Recycle-Reuse), awareness \& capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future.},

@article{Hino:2018aa,
	abstract = {Public agencies aiming to enforce environmental regulation have limited resources to achieve their objectives. We demonstrate how machine-learning methods can inform the efficient use of these limited resources while accounting for real-world concerns, such as gaming the system and institutional constraints. Here, we predict the likelihood of a facility failing a water-pollution inspection and propose alternative inspection allocations that would target high-risk facilities. Implementing such a data-driven inspection allocation could detect over seven times the expected number of violations than current practices. When we impose constraints, such as maintaining a minimum probability of inspection for all facilities and accounting for state-level differences in inspection budgets, our reallocation regimes double the number of violations detected through inspections. Leveraging increasing amounts of electronic data can help public agencies to enhance their regulatory effectiveness and remedy environmental harms. Although employing algorithm-based resource allocation rules requires care to avoid manipulation and unintentional error propagation, the principled use of predictive analytics can extend the beneficial reach of limited resources.},

ABSTRACT = {The widespread interest in using drones in maritime transport has rapidly grown alongside the development of unmanned ships and drones. To stimulate growth and address the associated technical challenges, this paper systematically reviews the relevant research progress, classification, applications, technical challenges, and possible solutions related to the use of drones in the maritime sector. The findings provide an overview of the state of the art of the applications of drones in the maritime industry over the past 20 years and identify the existing problems and bottlenecks in this field. A new classification scheme is established based on their flight characteristics to aid in distinguishing drones’ applications in maritime transport. Further, this paper discusses the specific use cases and technical aspects of drones in maritime rescue, safety, navigation, environment, communication, and other aspects, providing in-depth guidance on the future development of different mainstream applications. Lastly, the challenges facing drones in these applications are identified, and the corresponding solutions are proposed to address them. This research offers pivotal insights and pertinent knowledge beneficial to various entities such as maritime regulatory bodies, shipping firms, academic institutions, and enterprises engaged in drone production. This paper makes new contributions in terms of the comprehensive analysis and discussion of the application of drones in maritime transport and the provision of guidance and support for promoting their further development and integration with intelligent transport.},

ABSTRACT = {Microplastics are small plastic particles that come from the degradation of plastics, ubiquitous in nature and therefore affect both wildlife and humans. They have been detected in many marine species, but also in drinking water and in numerous foods, such as salt, honey and marine organisms. Exposure to microplastics can also occur through inhaled air. Data from animal studies have shown that once absorbed, plastic micro- and nanoparticles can distribute to the liver, spleen, heart, lungs, thymus, reproductive organs, kidneys and even the brain (crosses the blood–brain barrier). In addition, microplastics are transport operators of persistent organic pollutants or heavy metals from invertebrate organisms to other higher trophic levels. After ingestion, the additives and monomers in their composition can interfere with important biological processes in the human body and can cause disruption of the endocrine, immune system; can have a negative impact on mobility, reproduction and development; and can cause carcinogenesis. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has affected not only human health and national economies but also the environment, due to the large volume of waste in the form of discarded personal protective equipment. The remarkable increase in global use of face masks, which mainly contain polypropylene, and poor waste management have led to worsening microplastic pollution, and the long-term consequences can be extremely devastating if urgent action is not taken.},

abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in determining the amount and location of plastic debris in our seas, but how much plastic actually enters them in the first place is more uncertain. Jambeck et al. combine available data on solid waste with a model that uses population density and economic status to estimate the amount of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. Unless waste management practices are improved, the flux of plastics to the oceans could increase by an order of magnitude within the next decade. Science, this issue p. 768 Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans every year. Plastic debris in the marine environment is widely documented, but the quantity of plastic entering the ocean from waste generated on land is unknown. By linking worldwide data on solid waste, population density, and economic status, we estimated the mass of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. We calculate that 275 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million MT entering the ocean. Population size and the quality of waste management systems largely determine which countries contribute the greatest mass of uncaptured waste available to become plastic marine debris. Without waste management infrastructure improvements, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025.}}

ABSTRACT = {The problem of waste classification has been a major concern for both the government and society, and whether waste can be effectively classified will affect the sustainable development of human society. To perform fast and efficient detection of waste targets in the sorting process, this paper proposes a data augmentation + YOLO_EC waste detection system. First of all, because of the current shortage of multi-objective waste classification datasets, the heavy workload of human data collection, and the limited improvement of data features by traditional data augmentation methods, DCGAN (deep convolution generative adversarial networks) was optimized by improving the loss function, and an image-generation model was established to realize the generation of multi-objective waste images; secondly, with YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) as the basic model, EfficientNet is used as the backbone feature extraction network to realize the light weight of the algorithm, and at the same time, the CA (coordinate attention) attention mechanism is introduced to reconstruct the MBConv module to filter out high-quality information and enhance the feature extraction ability of the model. Experimental results show that on the HPU_WASTE dataset, the proposed model outperforms other models in both data augmentation and waste detection.},

ABSTRACT = {Water quality and pollution is the main environmental concern for ports and adjacent coastal waters. Therefore, the development of Port Environmental Management systems often relies on water pollution monitoring. Computer vision is a powerful and versatile tool for an exhaustive and systematic monitoring task. An investigation has been conducted at the Port of Palma de Mallorca (Spain) to assess the feasibility and evaluate the main opportunities and difficulties of the implementation of water pollution monitoring based on computer vision. Experiments on surface slicks and marine litter identification based on random image sets have been conducted. The reliability and development requirements of the method have been evaluated, concluding that computer vision is suitable for these monitoring tasks. Several computer vision techniques based on convolutional neural networks were assessed, finding that Image Classification is the most adequate for marine pollution monitoring tasks due to its high accuracy rates and low training requirements. Image set size for initial training and the possibility to improve accuracy through retraining with increased image sets were considered due to the difficulty in obtaining port spill images. Thus, we have found that progressive implementation can not only offer functional monitoring systems in a shorter time frame but also reduce the total development cost for a system with the same accuracy level.},
